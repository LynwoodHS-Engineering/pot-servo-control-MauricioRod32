The wiring is based on what was given to us. Writing the code had to iclude the pot value of the Potentiometer which was the resistance in the part. As you include the pot value, include the servo value mapped with the pot value. Now whenever I move the potentiometer it will move the servo based on the value I move in. The Serial.Print is to read all values both potentiometer value and the angle of the servo.
